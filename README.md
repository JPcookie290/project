# Virtual Pet Game

## Overview

This project is a virtual pet game where users can care for their pet by feeding it, keeping it clean, and managing its needs. The game allows players to interact with the pet through a simple UI, providing visual feedback on the pet's state. The goal is to maintain the petâ€™s needs and keep it happy!

## Features

- **Pet Interaction:** Feed, clean, and monitor your pet's health and happiness levels.
- **Randomized Events:** The game introduces random food types to keep the interaction varied.
- **Environmental Control:** Toggle the environment (light/dark mode) and manage the cleanliness of the surroundings.

## Current Status

- **Not Finished:** The project is still a work in progress.
- **Sleep Function Issue:** The sleep function is currently broken and does not behave as intended, causing problems with the pet's needs adjustment.
- **CSS Problems:** There are unresolved issues with the styling (CSS) that affect the visual presentation and layout of the game elements.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6):** Core logic for the game, including managing the pet's needs and environment.
- **HTML/CSS:** Basic structure and styling of the game's UI. There are known CSS issues to be resolved.
- **Modular Structure:** The game is split into different modules like `Pet`, `Food`, and `Background` to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.
